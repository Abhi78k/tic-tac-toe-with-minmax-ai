# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

This project is a fully functional **Tic Tac Toe game** built using **Python** and **Pygame**, where a human plays against an unbeatable **AI powered by the Minimax algorithm**.

## Gameplay Overview

- 2-player mode: You (player 1 - circles) vs AI (player 2 - crosses)
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make the best possible move every turn
- You can restart the game anytime by pressing the **`R` key**
- Green = You win, Red = AI wins, Gray = Draw

## Features

- Clean GUI built with `pygame`
- AI uses a recursive **Minimax** strategy
- Detects wins in all directions (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Highlights winner with color-coded symbols
- Resets with a single key press (`R`)

## AI Strategy: Minimax

- **Maximizing player (AI)**: tries to maximize score
- **Minimizing player (You)**: tries to minimize score
- Scores:

  - Win for AI: `+âˆž`
  - Win for Player: `-âˆž`
  - Draw: `0`
- The AI always plays optimally and is unbeatable

## Game UI

- 3x3 grid window
- Circle = Human player (white)
- Cross = AI (white/red)
- Color changes to indicate result:

  - **Green** â†’ You win
  - **Red** â†’ AI wins
  - **Gray** â†’ Draw

## File Structure

```
tictactoe2.py      # Main game logic and UI
README.md              # This file
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame



## Example

- Use your mouse to click a square and make a move. Press **`R`** to restart at any time.

```
You click a square â†’ Circle appears
AI plays immediately â†’ Cross appears
Game ends:
- Green shapes if you win
- Red shapes if AI wins
- Gray shapes if it's a draw
```

## **Demo**:
- The player always plays first.

- If the player loses the board becomes red.
